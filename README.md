Given a matrix, we have to return the first movement that we have to do to achieve the "F" element. so, every element tells you what movement every element do.
in that order, A means to above, B means to below, D means to the right and I means to the left, finally, the number indicate how many element you have to move. For example, 1A do 1 movement above, 2D do 2 movement to the right.
