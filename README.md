## Reto_cajafuerte
Given a matrix, we have to return the first movement that we have to do to achieve the "F" element. so, every element tells you what movement every element do.
in that order, A means to above, B means to below, D means to the right and I means to the left, finally, the number indicate how many element you have to move. For example, 1A do 1 movement above, 2D do 2 movement to the right.

## Reto_Cuadrilandia
Cuadriland is a world where everything is a square, something like minecraft, so, bikes have square rims that, in fact, are matrix NxN. so, Given a matrix we have to do a code that let us know the state of the matrix after a angle of 90째 or 45째. only for those angles. for example for 90째

1 2 3      7 4 1
4 5 6  --> 8 5 2 
7 8 9      9 6 3

for 45째 
1 2 3     4 1 2
4 5 6 --> 7 5 3
7 8 9     8 9 6
